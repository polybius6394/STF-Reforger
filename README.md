Hey, this is the repository for anything and everything Reforger within 1PH/STF.

Every mod in here should come with its own license and readme, preferably stating relationships with other mods, the workshop publisher, contributors, and a short description about the mod itself.

A few ground rules:
- Don't overwrite others' work without permission. Seriously, this sucks.
- If you're the publisher for a mod, make sure your local copy is up-to-date with the github.
- Ask before using others' work outside of 1PH/STF, even if the license states that you can. It never hurts to ask!
Beyond that, do literally whatever. Update and create 'til your heart's content.

If you want contributor status, dm me (poly), and I'll add you. Anyone is welcome!
Seriously, even if you're new to modding, ask us, we're more than willing ot help!
